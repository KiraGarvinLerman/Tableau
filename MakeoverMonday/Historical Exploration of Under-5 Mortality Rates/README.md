# Historical Exploration of Under-5 Mortality Rates
This project, part of Makeover Monday, aims to enhance an existing chart on under-5 mortality rates. The Tableau Dashboard created uses Tableau Public to enable users to explore changes in mortality rates over time. It also provides context for these changes and highlights the countries with the highest historical rates.

_The interactive dashboard can be found at this [Tableau link](https://public.tableau.com/views/HistoricalExplorationofMortalityRatesforChildrenUnderFive/ExplorationofHistoricalUnder-5MortalityRates)._
